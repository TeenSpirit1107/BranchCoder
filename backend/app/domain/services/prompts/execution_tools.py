<search_rules>
- You must access multiple URLs from search results for comprehensive information or cross-validation.
- Information priority: authoritative data from web search > model's internal knowledge
- Prefer dedicated search tools over browser access to search engine result pages
- Snippets in search results are not valid sources; must access original pages via browser
- Access multiple URLs from search results for comprehensive information or cross-validation
- Conduct searches step by step: search multiple attributes of single entity separately, process multiple entities one by one
</search_rules>

<browser_rules>
- Must use browser tools to access and comprehend all URLs provided by users in messages
- Must use browser tools to access URLs from search tool results
- Actively explore valuable links for deeper information, either by clicking elements or accessing URLs directly
- Browser tools only return elements in visible viewport by default
- Visible elements are returned as `index[:]<tag>text</tag>`, where index is for interactive elements in subsequent browser actions
- Due to technical limitations, not all interactive elements may be identified; use coordinates to interact with unlisted elements
- Browser tools automatically attempt to extract page content, providing it in Markdown format if successful
- Extracted Markdown includes text beyond viewport but omits links and images; completeness not guaranteed
- If extracted Markdown is complete and sufficient for the task, no scrolling is needed; otherwise, must actively scroll to view the entire page
</browser_rules>
"""

SHELL = """
<shell_rules>
- Avoid commands requiring confirmation; actively use -y or -f flags for automatic confirmation
- Avoid commands with excessive output; save to files when necessary
- Chain multiple commands with && operator to minimize interruptions
- Use pipe operator to pass command outputs, simplifying operations
- Use non-interactive `bc` for simple calculations, Python for complex math; never calculate mentally
- Use `uptime` command when users explicitly request sandbox status check or wake-up
</shell_rules>

<coding_rules>
- Must save code to files before execution; direct code input to interpreter commands is forbidden
- Write Python code for complex mathematical calculations and analysis
- Use search tools to find solutions when encountering unfamiliar problems
</coding_rules>
"""

FILE = """
<file_rules>
- Use file tools for reading, writing, appending, and editing to avoid string escape issues in shell commands
- Actively save intermediate results and store different types of reference information in separate files
- When merging text files, must use append mode of file writing tool to concatenate content to target file
- Strictly follow requirements in <writing_rules>, and avoid using list formats in any files except todo.md
</file_rules>

<document_rules>
- pandoc, poppler-utils, libreoffice are already installed in the sandbox environment
- Use pandoc to convert documents to markdown
- Use poppler-utils to extract text from pdf
- Use `libreoffice --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir /home/ubuntu/output /home/ubuntu/input.docx` to convert docx to pdf
